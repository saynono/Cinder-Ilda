/**  -- Introduction --
 * Only 2 functions have to be called and affect all connected devices. These are:
 *      EasyLaseGetCardNum
 *        Must be called befor using any other function.  Can also be called to
 *        try to reopen the connection when an error occurred.
 *  and EasyLaseClose
 *       Closes all devices. Should be called at the end of the application
 *       program.
 *  All other functions are optional and can be used independently from each
 *  other by the application.
 *
 * -- Lasershow output --
 * EasyLase outputs the data frame based. This means, always a complete show frame
 * will be transmitted via USB. When the frame is received by the device,
 * EasyLase will display it. A frame will always be displayed completely without
 * any interruptions. A running frame will not be interrupted by a new incoming frame.
 * The system is double buffered. A new frame can be received via USB, while another
 * frame is being output to the D/A-converters.
 * Important:
 * Frames need time to be output. The time is the result of number of points
 * multiplicated with the output time for each point (points per second).
 * Example:
 * At an output speed of 10000 pps and 1000 points, the frame needs 1000 / 10000 = 0.1
 * seconds or 100 milliseconds for display.
 * When more frames are transmitted via USB as can be displayed in the same time,
 * they will be discarded. This costs transmission bandwith and can lower the
 * communication speed. To avoid such data jam, a handshake can be implemented.
 * Using the function EasyLaseGetStatus, the application can check if the device is
 * ready to receive a new frame. This handshake should be used, but doesn't have to
 * be used. The application can send frames using EasyLaseWriteFrame every time,
 * without checking the status.
 * Frames will be repeated when no new frame is available. To avoid repetition,
 * use the EasyLaseWriteFrameNR function. Whenever a new frame is ready for
 * display, it will be output next.
 * To stop output the Function EasyLaseStop is implemented.
 */

/** Data Format Frame
 * A laser frame for output is an array of the following 8 byte structure:
 */
/*
 typedef struct {
 unsigned short x;  // 2 Bytes  Value 0 - 4095  X-Coordinate
 unsigned short y;  // 2 Bytes  Value 0 - 4095  Y-coordinate
 unsigned char  r;  // 1 Byte   Value 0 - 255   Red
 unsigned char  g;  // 1 Byte   Value 0 - 255   Green
 unsigned char  b;  // 1 Byte   Value 0 - 255   Blue
 unsigned char  i;  // 1 Byte   Value 0 - 255   Intensity
 } __attribute__((packed)) EasyLaseData, *EasyLasePoint;
 */
/** Data Format DMX
 * There are 2 basic functions available for reading or writing DMX-data.
 * All 512 channels can be accessed or only a selected number of channels.
 * The functions for accessing a limited number of channels are newly
 * implemented. The 2 other functions for accessing all 512 channels will
 * be available for compatibility. For lowering the data traffic, it is
 * recommended to use as few channels as possible. For both functions,
 * data will be accessed via a data array, where the lowest address
 * represents the lowest DMX-channel.
 * EasyLase USB generally reads all DMX-channels available on the DMX-line.
 * The application must decide what channels have to be transferred via USB.
 * For DMX-out, EasyLase USB outputs all channels beginning from channel 0
 * up to the highest channel written via USB. When the highest channel used
 * is significantly lower than 512, the repetition rate of the generated
 * DMX-signal can be increased, giving a higher refresh rate for DMX-devices.
 */

/** Data Format TTL
 * TTL-values are for output only. 16 Bits can be transferred via USB, 
 * but EasyLase will support the lower 8 bits only.
 */

/** Functions
 * Important: 	All functions, except EasyLaseGetCardNum and EasyLaseClose
 * refer to a selected device, which is addressed by the card number.
 * While the number of all cards can be 0 (no card) to 16, the selection
 * is 0 (first card) to 15. So when using 1 card, the number of cards is
 * 1, but the cardNumber is 0.
